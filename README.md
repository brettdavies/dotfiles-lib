# Dotfiles

Cross-platform dotfiles for macOS and headless Ubuntu servers — managed with
[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), secured with [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt).

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install Homebrew (skip if already installed)
#    macOS
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
#    Linux
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

# 2. Install core tools
brew install stow git-crypt

# 3. Clone and unlock
git clone git@github.com:brettdavies/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
git-crypt unlock ~/.config/git-crypt/key

# 4. Deploy
scripts/stow-deploy --all              # macOS: shared + desktop packages
scripts/stow-deploy --headless --all   # Linux: shared packages only
```

> **Stow >= 2.4.0 required.** Ubuntu 24.04 apt only has 2.3.1, which has a
> [bug with nested `dot-` directories][stow-bug]. Use Homebrew/Linuxbrew.

For detailed platform-specific setup (oh-my-zsh, Ghostty, Cursor extensions, iCloud sync), see
[BOOTSTRAP.md](BOOTSTRAP.md).

### Stow Packages

Each directory under `stow/` is a package. Files prefixed with `dot-` become dotfiles (`.` prefix) when symlinked via
`stow --dotfiles`.

| Package              | What it manages                                                                                                                  |

Two packages deploy outside the `stow-deploy --all` flow: `caddy` (the Linux-only Ollama proxy host) is stowed
explicitly with `scripts/stow-deploy caddy`, and `ollama` targets `/etc` rather than `$HOME`, stowed with `sudo stow -t
/etc -d stow ollama` (see [stow/ollama/README.md](stow/ollama/README.md)).

### Tmuxinator Sessions

Session configs live in `stow/tmuxinator/dot-config/tmuxinator/` and are **not** stowed. `config/shell/tmuxinator.sh`
exports `TMUXINATOR_CONFIG` to point at that directory, so tmuxinator reads, writes, and lists projects in the repo
itself — `tmuxinator new` and `tmuxinator copy` land on the source of truth with no deploy step.

Keep `~/.config/tmuxinator` empty. tmuxinator searches that path in `start` and `stop` but not in `list`, so a config
sitting there shadows the repo: it starts a session that never appears in `tmuxinator list`. `sudo tmuxinator …` is the
usual way one gets there, because `sudo` scrubs `TMUXINATOR_CONFIG` and falls back to the XDG path — and it strands the
tmux server at UID 0, invisible to your own `tmux ls`. Run tmuxinator as yourself.

Every config defines the same 3-pane working layout: yazi on the left (1/3 width, full height), a bare shell top-right
(2/3 × 2/3), and lazygit bottom-right (2/3 × 1/3). All three panes start in the project's root.

Start or attach to a configured session with `tmuxinator start <name>` — it creates the session on the first call and
attaches on every subsequent call, so the same command works whether or not the session is already running:

```bash
tmuxinator start anc                          # local terminal
mux start anc                                 # zsh shell alias (same thing)
ssh <dev-host> -t tmuxinator start anc        # over SSH (preferred connection idiom)
```

Raw `tmux attach -t <name>` only works after the session has already been started, which makes it the wrong default for
SSH.

To create a new session from scratch (config + first start in one shot), use `tmux-new-session <name> <repo-path>` — it
writes a new tmuxinator config into `stow/tmuxinator/dot-config/tmuxinator/`, then runs `tmuxinator start`.

`tmuxinator copy` duplicates a config verbatim, including the source project's `name:` and its `on_project_first_start`
resize targets. Edit both after copying, or the new session resizes panes in the project it was copied from.
`tests/tmuxinator-configs.bats` enforces that every config's resize targets match its own `name:`.

### System-Level Units (`config/systemd/system/`)

System-level systemd units are **not** managed by stow (which targets `$HOME`). They live in `config/systemd/system/`
and are deployed via `scripts/nas-deploy.sh`, which copies them to `/etc/systemd/system/` and activates them.

| Unit                | Purpose                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `mnt-nas.mount`     | SMB mount for the NAS (`//<nas-host>/openclaw`) |
| `mnt-nas.automount` | On-demand automount, solves WiFi boot race      |

**Deploy:** `sudo scripts/nas-deploy.sh` (requires `/root/.smbcredentials-<nas-host>` from 1Password).

Three more system-level configs deploy through their own paths: `apparmor-playwright.service` (with the AppArmor
profile, via `scripts/apparmor-deploy.sh`, below), the `ollama` loopback override (`sudo stow -t /etc`, see the
`ollama` package), and the sshd locale change (`sudo scripts/sshd-locale-deploy.sh`, which edits `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
in place; see [BOOTSTRAP.md § SSH session locale](BOOTSTRAP.md#ssh-session-locale)).

### Playwright / browse browser launch (`scripts/playwright-deps-deploy.sh`)

On Linux the `browse` tool and Playwright e2e need three things to launch browsers: the browser binaries in the shared
cache, an AppArmor profile (for Chromium's sandbox), and, for Safari/iOS testing, WebKit system libraries. One script
provisions all three, run as your normal user (it escalates to sudo only where needed):

```bash
scripts/playwright-deps-deploy.sh            # browser binaries + AppArmor profile + boot persistence (Chromium / browse)
scripts/playwright-deps-deploy.sh --webkit   # + Safari/iOS system libs (WebKit, heavy ~380 MB)
scripts/playwright-deps-deploy.sh --all       # + Chromium and WebKit system libs
```

The **browser binaries** are provisioned into the shared cache (`$PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`) by
`scripts/playwright-browsers-deploy.sh` (run directly, or via the script above) using `curl` + `unzip` rather than
`playwright install` — node's extractor deadlocks on this host's io_uring/kernel combo. One canonical version serves
every repo, so per-repo `playwright install` becomes a no-op; bumping it is a dotfiles edit (the revision map in that
script). WebKit deps are opt-in because they pull ~180 packages and are only needed for Safari/iOS e2e (the `mobile-ios`
/ `tablet` projects). See [docs/runbooks/playwright-browser-launch.md](docs/runbooks/playwright-browser-launch.md) for
failure signatures, the io_uring root cause, and recovery.

**AppArmor profiles** (`config/apparmor.d/`) are deployed by `scripts/apparmor-deploy.sh` (called by the script above,
or run standalone as `sudo scripts/apparmor-deploy.sh`), which copies each file to `/etc/apparmor.d/`, loads it with
`apparmor_parser -r`, and installs `apparmor-playwright.service` to reload it at boot. The boot unit is required because
Ubuntu's own `apparmor.service` is skipped at boot on minimized server images, so `/etc/apparmor.d/` is otherwise never
reloaded and the profile drops on reboot.

| Profile      | Purpose                                                                                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `playwright` | Grants `userns` to Playwright's bundled Chromium so the browse tool works on Ubuntu 24.04 |

### Shell Environment (`config/shell/`)

`.profile` sources every `*.sh` file in `config/shell/` automatically — drop a file in and it's picked up, no manifest
needed.

The loop runs after `.profile` finishes assembling `PATH` (Homebrew, `~/.local/bin`, bun, cargo). Files here routinely
gate their contents on `command -v <tool>`, and that guard is evaluated at source time: sourced any earlier, every such
file would silently no-op in a shell that did not inherit a populated `PATH` — a launchd-spawned terminal, cron, or `ssh
host cmd`. `tests/shell-startup-shapes.bats` pins the ordering and exercises each shell shape;
`tests/shell-path-matrix.bats` checks `PATH` assembly across all eight supported invocation shapes, tabulated in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#supported-invocation-shapes).

Shell startup latency budgets live in `tests/perf/`, outside the `tests/*.bats` glob that the pre-push hook and CI use.
The hook runs that directory first, on a quiet machine, and each measurement is a best-of-N minimum: run at the tail of
the full suite, the several hundred shells it spawns push interactive zsh past its budget with nothing about the config
having changed.

| File                | Purpose                                                        |

| `xurl.sh`           | Alias `xurl` to the `xr` binary (xurl-rs)                      |

## Secrets Management

Sensitive files are encrypted with git-crypt:

- `stow/secrets/dot-secrets` — API keys and tokens
- `stow/ssh/dot-ssh/config` — SSH host configurations
- `stow/git/dot-config/git/allowed_signers` — SSH allowed signers

Git hooks auto-unlock on checkout and merge. Back up `~/.config/git-crypt/key` in a password manager — if lost,
encrypted files cannot be recovered.

## Git Hooks

Activated via `core.hooksPath` (set automatically by `stow-deploy`):

| Hook            | Purpose                                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `pre-commit`    | Blocks commits on `main`, verifies `commit.gpgsign` |
| `post-checkout` | Auto-unlocks git-crypt, chains Git LFS              |
| `post-merge`    | Auto-unlocks git-crypt, chains Git LFS              |
| `pre-push`      | Mirrors CI (shellcheck + bats), chains Git LFS      |

## CI and Testing

| Workflow         | Trigger        | Purpose                                             |
| ---------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `release.yml`    | Push to `main` | CalVer tag, changelog via git-cliff, GitHub Release |
| `shellcheck.yml` | Pull request   | Lints shell scripts and hooks                       |
| `bats.yml`       | Pull request   | Runs the bats-core test suites                      |

`shellcheck.yml` and `bats.yml` are required status checks on `dev` and `main`. They run on every pull request with no
path filter so the required context is always reported. The `pre-push` hook runs the same shellcheck and bats checks
locally and skips them for markdown-only pushes.

Shell scripts are tested with [bats-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) (`bats tests/`). Suites cover
stow-deploy, git hooks, shell config, supply-chain age gates, symlinks, the qmd-serve and opendataloader-pdf units, and
the CLI wrappers.

## Performance

Shell startup budgets are enforced — non-interactive shells must start under 200ms, interactive shells under 500ms.

See `docs/solutions/performance-issues/` for optimization details.

## Cross-Platform Notes

- `$OSTYPE` checks gate macOS-specific features; `$HOME` used everywhere
- Homebrew paths: `/opt/homebrew` (macOS) vs `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew` (Linux)
- Git signing: 1Password on macOS, `ssh-keygen` fallback on Linux (via `op-ssh-sign-wrapper`)
- SSH config uses `Match exec` for platform-conditional 1Password agent paths
- All GitHub/Gist URLs rewritten to SSH via `url.insteadOf` in `.gitconfig`
- SSH key: `~/.ssh/brett_ed25519` on all machines
- oh-my-zsh plugins: brew symlinks on macOS, git clones on Linux

## Release Automation

Every squash merge to `main` triggers a GitHub Action that computes a CalVer version (`YYYY.MM.DD`), tags the commit,
and creates a GitHub Release. Release notes are extracted from the topmost section of the committed `CHANGELOG.md`. See
[RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md) for the end-to-end flow (feature branch → dev → `release/*` overlay branch → main).

### CI_RELEASE_TOKEN Secret

The workflow pushes back to protected `main`, which requires a fine-grained PAT stored as the `CI_RELEASE_TOKEN` repo
secret.

**Create / rotate the token:**

```bash
op read "op://secrets-dev/dotfiles_RELEASE_TOKEN/credential" \
  | gh secret set CI_RELEASE_TOKEN
```

**Creating a new PAT** (if the 1Password entry doesn't exist):

1. Go to <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new>
2. **Repository access:** `brettdavies/dotfiles` only
3. **Permissions:** Contents: Read and write
4. Save to 1Password at `secrets-dev/dotfiles_RELEASE_TOKEN`
5. Run the `gh secret set` command above

## Documentation

Project vocabulary is defined in [CONCEPTS.md](CONCEPTS.md). Operational runbooks live in `docs/runbooks/` (headless GPU
driver drift, Playwright browser launch). Past solutions and design decisions live in `docs/solutions/` (a symlink to a
separate private repo):

- **Deployment** — cross-platform stow deployment, shell config fixes, headless git signing, conflict resolution
- **Configuration** — branch divergence reconciliation, workflow enforcement
- **Performance** — shell startup optimization, zsh interactive startup tuning
