# Releases rationale

Companion to [`RELEASES.md`](./RELEASES.md). RELEASES.md is the runbook (commands, paths, decision tables). This file
holds the WHY behind those rules: branching model, PR conventions, triple-diff verification, CHANGELOG generation,
release pipeline, prose-check scope, branch-protection pitfalls.

Read this when a rule in RELEASES.md doesn't make sense and you're tempted to change it, when a future you asks "why do
we do X this way," or when adding a new release-flow rule and you need to know where it fits.

## Branching model

### Forever `dev`, ephemeral release branches

`dev` is never deleted, even after a release. The next release cycle reuses the same `dev`. The repo's
`delete_branch_on_merge` setting can't touch `dev` as long as `dev` is never the head of a PR. Using a short-lived
`release/*` head is what keeps that setting compatible with a forever integration branch, and `guard-release-branch.yml`
rejects any PR to `main` whose head is not `release/*`, so the pattern is enforced rather than remembered.

Planning-only docs (`docs/plans/`, `docs/brainstorms/`, `docs/ideation/`, `docs/research/`, `docs/reviews/`,
`docs/solutions/`, `.context/`) live on `dev` only and never reach `main`. They are inert text that doesn't ship, so
they skip the feature-branch ceremony and commit directly to `dev`. The release recipe strips them from the release
branch, `guard-main-docs.yml` blocks them from any PR to `main`, and the leak check in RELEASES.md is the local
backstop. Consumer-facing markdown (README, AGENTS, CHANGELOG, the RELEASES trio) is not in that exception: it ships to
`main`, so it goes through the standard PR flow.

### Why the release branch is cut from `main`, never from `dev`

Every release squash-merges into `main`, so `main` and `dev` diverge in history even as their content converges; in this
repo the two share no common ancestor at all. Cutting the release branch from `dev`, or merging `dev` into `main`,
forces a three-way merge across that divergence: `add/add` collisions on files both sides changed, plus rename/delete
pairs git cannot auto-resolve. The conflict pile is an artifact of the lineage, not of the content shipping. A merge
also pulls every ancestor SHA on `dev` into `main`'s history, including commits already collapsed into earlier release
squashes, which is what made `git-cliff --unreleased` re-emit old entries in every new changelog.

Always cut the release branch from `origin/main` and bring `dev`'s content onto it as a forward diff, never by
reconciling histories. The construction is the whole-tree overlay (`git checkout origin/dev -- .`, remove the main-only
files `dev` deleted, then strip the guarded set): `main` ships `dev`'s tree minus a small, known exclusion set, so
asserting that end-state directly is simpler and safer than hand-resolving a merge or cherry-picking one PR at a time.
The overlay commit carries no per-PR history, so the changelog is built from the PRs merged into `dev` since the
previous release (`generate-changelog.py --from-dev-prs`) rather than from the branch's commits; the result is the same
per-PR section a cherry-picked branch would yield. Cherry-picking the dev squash-commits is kept only as an exception
for a release with a stated reason it cannot overlay, at the cost of guarded-path conflict handling.

Either way, the release must start from a `main` that `dev` fully contains. Security PRs, hotfixes, and config edits
land on `main` first, and the overlay takes `dev`'s content for every file it touches, so anything `main` holds that
`dev` never received is reverted by the release. `scripts/release/drift.sh` lists that set and the cut waits until it is
empty.

### Why direct-to-dev commits never need excluding

The overlay takes `dev`'s whole tree, so nothing is selected by commit. The direct-to-`dev` commits the dev-direct
exception allows only touch guarded paths, and the strip step removes those paths by name from the workflow's registered
set. A change that needs to ship comes in via its own PR, which is also what makes it appear in the changelog:
`--from-dev-prs` enumerates merged PRs, not commits.

### Version branch naming

`release/YYYY.MM.DD` (or `release/YYYY.MM.DD.N` for a same-day rerun) matches the tag CI will create, keeps release
branches sortable, and is what `generate-changelog.py` reads the version from. The generator also accepts
`release/vX.Y.Z` for SemVer repos; this repo tags without a prefix, so the branch carries none either.

## PR body conventions

### No explainer prose in the body

Every section is user-facing substance only: the **net diff**, what changes for the consumer that wasn't there before,
not the commit history or intermediate state that produced it. Workflow mechanics (overlay, regenerate, pre-push gate,
CI behavior) are documented in RELEASES.md and `.github/`, not in the PR body. Verification artifacts (diff output,
leak-check narration, drift-gate output, CI status) stay local; anomalies get fixed before push, not audit-trailed.

### Why `feat`/`fix` are preferred over `chore`

`cliff.toml` drops commits whose subject starts with `chore`, `style`, `test`, `ci`, or `build`, regardless of body
content, and `--from-dev-prs` applies the same rule to a PR title when the body carries no `## Changelog` content.
Mistyping a user-facing change as `chore` silently strips it from release notes. Prefer `feat` / `fix` for anything
user-observable: config defaults, env vars, shell aliases, templates, default behaviors.

### Why required-when-empty sub-headers

`Related Issues/Stories` has four labels and `Files Modified` has four sub-headers. All must appear in every PR even
when empty; write `- None.` or `n/a` rather than deleting them. Scanners and humans both rely on a known section shape;
conditionally-absent sections force every reader to check "did the author skip this or does it not apply?"

### Why no AI attribution and no hard wraps

`Co-Authored-By: Claude ...`, "Generated with" trailers, or any AI-attribution trailer is banned from commits and PR
bodies; they are noise and age poorly. Author each paragraph and bullet as one logical line; GitHub soft-wraps for
display, and hard wraps produce mid-sentence breaks in some renderers and interfere with the `unslop` line-anchored
scan.

## Triple-diff verification

The overlay recipe runs two staged diffs (A: what the release tree differs from `dev` in, B: no guarded path against
`main`) plus the enumeration in D. The cherry-pick exception runs the fuller triple-diff (A: main to release, B: release
to dev filtered by the guarded set, C: dev to main) plus a patch-id cherry check, because missed cherry-picks have
shipped to `main` on sibling repos before, and the file-level diff in B alone doesn't catch the patch-id false-negative
class.

### Why the guarded set resolves from the workflow

`guard-main-docs` is what CI enforces on a PR to `main`: the reusable workflow's hardcoded base list plus this repo's
`extra_paths`. Every hand-kept copy of that union (runbook, checklist, release script) drifted from it, and a copy that
omits a guarded path reports a real leak as clean while CI turns red after the push. `scripts/release/guarded-paths.sh`
reads `extra_paths` out of the caller workflow and adds the base list, so registering a path in the workflow is the only
edit a new guarded path needs. The base list is the one copy that still needs a manual edit when the reusable changes,
because it lives in another repo. Entries are globs with one rule set shared by the reusable and the script (`**/` any
depth, `*` and `?` within a segment, trailing slash guards the subtree), so the two never disagree about what is
guarded.

### Why the release enumerates what it adds

The leak check screens the diff against the registered set, so it says nothing about a category nobody registered. A new
engineering directory or a stray note under `docs/` passes the local check and `guard-main-docs` alike. Step D lists
every `docs/` file and every markdown file the release adds to `main` outside the guarded set and puts them in front of
a human; each one needs a reason to ship, or it gets registered in `extra_paths` and dropped from the branch. Root-level
markdown is in scope because an agent-facing glossary at the repo root is exactly the kind of addition a `docs/`-only
listing misses.

### Why the patch-id cherry-check output is noisy

In a squash-merge workflow, `git cherry HEAD origin/dev` emits many `+` lines that need human triage. They do NOT
auto-block the release. Expected false positives:

1. **Historical commits squash-merged in prior releases.** The squash commit on `main` has a different patch-id than the
   `dev` commits it consolidates, so old commits show as `+` forever. Anything older than the previous tag is almost
   always this.
2. **Cherry-picks where conflict resolution stripped guarded paths** or otherwise altered the tree. Same intent,
   different patch-id.
3. **Intentionally skipped commits**: direct-to-dev planning-doc commits, prior release-prep backports.

A real miss looks like a recent `feat`/`fix` commit on `dev` whose *file content* is not yet on `main`. Triage a `+`
line with `git show <sha> --stat` then `git diff origin/main..HEAD -- <those-files>`. If every touched file is guarded
or already on `main` via a prior squash, it's a false positive.

## CHANGELOG generation

### Generated, never hand-written

`scripts/generate-changelog.py` (vendored from the `github-repo-setup` skill, with the repo-local `cliff.toml`) is the
only sanctioned way to update `CHANGELOG.md`. On the overlay-built release branch it runs as `--from-dev-prs`: the PRs
merged into `dev` since the previous release are the entries, and each PR's body supplies its `## Changelog → ###
Breaking changes / Added / Changed / Fixed / Documentation` subsections (with author and PR-link attribution). The
window starts at the earlier of the previous tag's commit time and the previous `release/*` PR's creation time, and PR
numbers the changelog already lists are dropped, so a PR merged between the previous cut and its tag is neither lost nor
doubled. On a cherry-picked branch it runs `git-cliff` first to prepend a versioned entry from the branch's commits,
then expands the same way.

If a PR's body carries no changelog content, its title becomes a `Changed` bullet, except for `chore`, `ci`, `build`,
`style`, and `test` PRs, which stay out unless they carry a `## Changelog` of their own. To fix a wrong entry, fix the
input: edit the squash-merged PR body or title on GitHub, then re-run the script. Never hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md`; the
next regeneration overwrites it.

### Why `cliff.toml` skips chore/style/test/ci/build

These types don't produce user-facing content. The footgun: if a shipping PR has user-facing `## Changelog` content but
its title starts with one of those types, its bullets are silently dropped. After running the script, cross-check the
generated section against `gh pr view <num> --json body` for each PR in the window; correct mistyped PR titles (e.g.
`chore` → `feat`) with `gh pr edit` and re-run. `cliff.toml` also anchors releases on the bare CalVer tag pattern
(`YYYY.MM.DD` with an optional suffix), so a `v`-prefixed tag would not be a release boundary here.

## Release pipeline

### Why the tag is created in CI, not locally

`release.yml` computes the CalVer version (`YYYY.MM.DD` in America/Los_Angeles, with a `.N` suffix when today already
has tags) and creates the tag on push to `main`. Doing this in CI rather than locally makes the date and
same-day-collision logic a single source of truth: no local clock or timezone drift, and same-day re-releases auto-bump
without any local action. The workflow uses `CI_RELEASE_TOKEN` (a fine-grained PAT) because the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`
can't push past `protect-main.json`.

The tag is **bare** (non-annotated): the workflow runs as `github-actions[bot]`, which has no signing key, and
`tag.gpgsign = true` globally would make a local annotated tag the only signed option. The release commit is already
attributable through its squash-merge PR; the tag is just a pointer.

### Why backport with a surgical CHANGELOG copy, by PR

`release/*` is cut from `origin/main` and regenerates `CHANGELOG.md` there against `main`'s base. That CHANGELOG commit
never round-trips to `dev`, so `dev`'s `CHANGELOG.md` freezes behind every release without a deliberate backport.

The backport is a PR opened by `scripts/sync-dev-after-release.sh`, never a merge of `main` into `dev` and never a
direct push. `dev` is normally many commits ahead of `main`, the two histories share no ancestry, and `main` carries
only the release squash plus the regenerated changelog, so a merge conflicts on every file both sides touched and drags
`main`'s tree state across `dev`'s unreleased work; a direct push bypasses `dev`'s required checks. `CHANGELOG.md` is
the one file that legitimately diverges, so it's the only file that moves. The fleet template of this script also writes
the released version into `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, or `VERSION`; this repo has no version carrier
(CI derives the tag from the date), so its copy stays a CalVer, CHANGELOG-only fork rather than growing a `VERSION` file
that nothing reads. The script refuses to run on a dirty tree or before the GitHub Release is published, and is
idempotent (no-op when `dev` already matches `main`).

### Rollback

Rollback happens at the surface users consume, not in git. For a config repo that surface is each deployed host's
checkout: re-stowing the previous tag on a host is fast and reversible, while rewriting `main` is neither, and the
release flow exists so that `main` only ever moves forward through a PR. After the rollback, the fix or revert lands
through `dev`, a release branch, and `main` like any other change, so the branch reconverges with what hosts run.
Recording the last-good tag before the release is what makes the rollback a single command under incident pressure.

### Why `[skip ci]` exists for emergency main pushes

Any push to `main` triggers `release.yml` and therefore a release. A docs-only fix pushed straight to `main` (a README
typo) would cut a spurious release, so `[skip ci]` in the commit message suppresses the workflow. This is the escape
hatch, not the norm; the standard release-branch flow is preferred whenever there's time for it.

## Prose scrubbing scope

Three release-flow artifacts ship text to GitHub outside any in-repo formatter and need a manual scrub: PR bodies (`gh
pr create`/`edit` send body text straight to GitHub), `CHANGELOG.md` (generated from upstream PR bodies, so it inherits
their prose), and the release-PR body (composed after `CHANGELOG.md` is generated).

This repo runs `unslop` (`~/.claude/skills/unslop/scripts/score.py`) as the minimum prose floor: em-dash density plus
AI-unique structural patterns. The full Vale + LanguageTool stack is not wired up here; `unslop` is the floor every
brettdavies repo gets regardless. Author each artifact in `/tmp/`, scrub there, and submit via `--body-file`, so the
public PR only ever sees clean text. For a `CHANGELOG.md` finding, fix the upstream PR body (which
`generate-changelog.py` re-fetches every run) and regenerate.

## Branch protection

### Status-check context strings

The `required_status_checks[].context` strings in the rulesets must match exactly what GitHub publishes for each check.
An inline job (with a `name:` field) publishes as just `<job-name>`; a reusable-workflow caller (`uses:
.../foo.yml@ref`) publishes as `<caller-job-id> / <reusable-job-id-or-name>`. Mixing these produces a stuck-but-green
PR: every actual check reports green, but the ruleset waits forever on a context that never appears. This repo's own
checks (`shellcheck`, `bats`) are inline jobs, so their contexts are the bare job names; the guard callers are
reusable-workflow callers, so theirs are `guard-docs / check-forbidden-docs`, `guard-provenance / check-provenance`, and
`guard-release / check-release-branch-name`. Confirm the real contexts after a CI run with `gh api
repos/brettdavies/dotfiles/commits/<sha>/check-runs --jq '.check_runs[].name'`.

`shellcheck` and `bats` are required on both `dev` (where feature PRs land) and `main`; by the time a `release/*` PR
reaches `main` the same commits already passed those checks on `dev`, and `release.yml` runs post-merge regardless.

### Why rulesets live in-repo

Committing the JSON under `.github/rulesets/` means ruleset changes land via the same review process as workflow
changes: a `chore(ci): tighten protect-main` change goes through `dev → release/* → main` like anything else.
