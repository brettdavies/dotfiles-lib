# Purpose: Ensures ~/.local/bin is in PATH for user-installed binaries
# This allows local binaries to override system binaries when needed
# and provides a standard location for user-installed scripts/tools
#
# Note: This file is sourced by .profile to make ~/.local/bin available
# in all shell sessions. The script checks if the path is already present
# to avoid duplicate entries.

# add binaries to PATH if they aren't added yet
# affix colons on either side of $PATH to simplify matching

        # Prepending path in case a system-installed binary needs to be overridden
