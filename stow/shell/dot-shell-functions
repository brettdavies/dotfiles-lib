# Shared shell functions for bash and zsh
# This file is sourced by both .bashrc and .zshrc

# OSC 7 support: Report current directory to terminal (for better terminal integration)
# This allows terminals like Ghostty to track the current working directory
# Format: \033]7;file://hostname/path\033\\
# Usage: Call this function from shell-specific prompt hooks
_osc7_report_directory() {
    # Try HOSTNAME first (bash default), then HOST (zsh default), fallback to localhost
    local hostname="${HOSTNAME:-${HOST:-localhost}}"
    printf '\033]7;file://%s%s\033\\' "$hostname" "$PWD"
}
